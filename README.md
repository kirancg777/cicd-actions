# CI/CD using Actions and deploying using Minikube Kubernetes Cluster
# Steps
1. To set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for a Node.js app using Docker and a Minikube Kubernetes cluster, you can follow these steps:
Set up Minikube: 
1. Install Minikube on your development machine and start the cluster. Minikube allows you to run a local Kubernetes cluster for development and testing purposes.
1. Create a Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your Node.js application. The Dockerfile describes the steps to build a Docker image for your app. Here's an example Dockerfile for a Node.js app:
1. Create Kubernetes deployment files: Create Kubernetes deployment files (deployment.yaml, service.yaml, etc.) in a directory called kubernetes within your project. These files describe how your app should be deployed and exposed as a Kubernetes service. Make sure to customize the files according to your app's requirements.
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow: In your repository, create a new directory called .github/workflows. Inside this directory, create a YAML file (e.g., ci-cd.yaml) to define your CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions. Here's an example workflow file:
1. Configure Docker credentials: In your GitHub repository settings, navigate to "Secrets" and add the Docker username and password as secrets (DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD). These credentials will be used to log in to your Docker registry during the CI/CD workflow.
1. Commit and push: Commit the Dockerfile, Kubernetes deployment files, GitHub Actions workflow file, and any other necessary files to your repository. Push the changes to the main branch.
#Once you've completed these steps, every time you push changes to the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger. It will build the Docker image, push it to the registry, and deploy the app to your Minikube Kubernetes cluster.
